Platforms such as YouTube, Facebook and Reddit are operated by companies that can be influenced in various ways. On the one hand, through political guidelines and regulations, and on the other hand, through company shareholdings and capital.

As a result, a few people and organizations have influence over what content is disseminated, deleted or [shadow-banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_banning). Unpopular or critical content is restricted according to the consultation of the stakeholders. In this way, small individual groups decide which content the masses will see. High-reach platforms have a strong influence on the formation of political and social opinion.

To counteract this development, the idea of a decentralized platform managed by the community itself was born. Members in the community are rewarded for good content and punished for harmful content. The community itself decides how content is classified (good/bad).
