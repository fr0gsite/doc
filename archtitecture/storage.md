# Storage

There are two types of storage in the fr0gsite ecosystem.

1. Storage of the blockchain itself, which is stored inside the Random Access Memory (RAM) of block producers. The RAM is a very fast storage, but also very expensive. The RAM is used to store the state of the blockchain and all meta data of content.

2. Storage of the content (images, videos, ...), which is stored inside the IPFS network. The IPFS network is a decentralized storage network. To store content inside the IPFS network, you can choose an IPFS provider with will store your content for you. Most provider have a free tier. You can also host your own IPFS node, but this is not recommended for most users, because it requires some technical knowledge and a good and stable internet connection.
