On the one hand, through political guidelines and regulations, and on the other hand, through company shareholdings and capital.","As a result, a few people and organizations have influence over what content is disseminated, deleted or shadow-banned. Unpopular or critical content is restricted according to the consultation of the stakeholders. In this way, small individual groups decide which content the masses will see. High-reach platforms have a strong influence on the formation of political and social opinion.","To counteract this development, the idea of a decentralized platform managed by the community itself was born. Members in the community are rewarded for good content and punished for harmful content.

These keys are used to sign and verify transactions, ensuring that only the holder of the private key can execute transactions on behalf of the associated account.","Account Creation: To interact with the network, one must first create an account. During account creation, specific permissions are assigned to one or more public keys. These keys are then used for authentication and to sign transactions.","Permission Levels: The system employs a multi-level permission structure. Each account can have various levels of permissions for different types of transactions. This flexible structure allows users to set up permissions according to their specific needs, enhancing security and operational efficiency.","Signing Transactions: To perform a transaction, the user signs it with their private key. This signature is used to verify that the transaction has been authorized by the owner of the account. The network checks the signature against the public key associated with the account's permissions."]}],[{"l":"Storage","p":["There are two types of storage in the fr0gsite ecosystem.","Storage of the blockchain itself, which is stored inside the Random Access Memory (RAM) of block producers.

The IPFS network is a decentralized storage network. To store content inside the IPFS network, you can choose an IPFS provider with will store your content for you. Most provider have a free tier.
